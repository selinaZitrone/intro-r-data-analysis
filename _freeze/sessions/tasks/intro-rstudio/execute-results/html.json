This would allow you to start the next session exactly where you left it by loading the `.Rdata` file.\n\nThis is not a good default. We always want to start R from a clean slate to ensure reproducibility and minimize error potential.\n\nIn RStudio go to **Tools -> Global Options -> General** and \n\n- Remove the check mark for \"Restore .RData into workspace at startup\"\n- **Never** \"Save workspace to .RData on exit\"\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='intro-rstudio_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_8be43fd86b790fd4cfd25a9bdddb4777'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"sessions/tasks/img/setting_workspace.png\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](img/setting_workspace.png){width=320}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Create an RStudio project\n\nCreate an RStudio project for all the scripts, notes, data, etc. from this workshop:\n\n1. Create a project in a directory of your choice following the instructions from the slides\n2. Use the **Files pane** in RStudio to create a basic folder structure in your project which will be filled with files in the next days\n  - Folder `data/` for all data files \n  - Folder `R/` for all R scripts\n  - Folder `docs/` for other documents (e.g. lecture notes or slides)\n  - You can always change the structure of your project later\n\nYou can add files to your project either directly in RStudio, or in the file explorer of your operating system.\n\n## Add an R script to the project\n\n- Create a new R script and save it in the `R/` folder of your project\n- Copy and paste the code from below into your script\n  - Don't worry if you don't understand the code yet, we will learn all this later\n- Run the code in the script line by line. Try both, running code using the **Run button** (in the top right corner of your script pane) and the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`\n  - For each line that you run, observe what is happening to the different panes (console, environment, ...) in RStudio. Can you explain what is happening?\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='intro-rstudio_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_a6f84456cd499f06c89463c7ce6bc669'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Look at the first lines of the iris dataset\nhead(iris)\n# What is the iris dataset -> Call the help\n?iris\n# How many rows and columns does the data set have?\nrownum <- nrow(iris)\ncolnum <- ncol(iris)\nprint(paste0(\"The iris dataset has \", rownum, \" rows and \", colnum, \" columns.\"))\n# Some summary statistics on the iris data set\nsummary(iris)\n\n# create a plot\nplot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width,\n  xlab = \"Petal Length\",\n  ylab = \"Petal Width\",\n  main = \"Petal Width vs Petal Length\",\n  pch = 20,\n  col = ifelse(iris$Species == \"setosa\", \"coral1\",\n    ifelse(iris$Species == \"virginica\", \"cyan4\",\n      ifelse(iris$Species == \"versicolor\",\n        \"darkgoldenrod2\", \"grey\"\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n# add a legend\nlegend(\"bottomright\", c(\"setosa\", \"virginica\", \"versicolor\"),\n  col = c(\"coral1\", \"cyan4\", \"darkgoldenrod2\"), pch = 20\n)\n```\n:::\n",
