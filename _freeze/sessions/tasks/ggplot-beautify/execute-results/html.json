If you still have time, you can come back to the task you didnâ€™t do.\n\nBut also here, if you have other ideas, feel free to deviate from the tasks.\n\n### 1.1 Beautify the plots from Task 1\n\nTake the plot from before that you liked the most and try to make them look nicer.\n\nHere's a list of ideas:\n\n- Add a theme layer\n- Customize the theme, e.g.\n  - Change the position of the legend\n  - Make the axis titles bold\n- Change the color/fill scale of the plot\n  - Use `scale_color_manual` or `scale_fill_manual`\n  - Try `scale_color_viridis_d()` or `scale_fill_viridis_d()` with different options\n  - Try a color scale from the `paletteer` package\n    - First you have to install the package, then have a look at the [available palettes](https://r-charts.com/color-palettes)\n- Change the labels of the x- and y-axis and add a title to the plot\n- Make the points transparent, give them a different shape, ...\n\n### 1.2 Can you reproduce this plot?\n\nTake a look at this plot:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='ggplot-beautify_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_b5608880b530d71b50d23a95aa9a835b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"sessions/slides/img/figs-penguin/README-flipper-bill-1.png\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visualization from the [palmerpenguins package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)](../slides/img/figs-penguin/README-flipper-bill-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt is similar to the one from Task 1-3.1 but more beautiful.\nCan you reproduce this plot?\n\nThe colors that are used are:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='ggplot-beautify_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_45b5654d80cb3b3a97f0a81ec204e72e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguin_cols <- c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 2 Save one of the plots on your machine\n\nSave one of the plots you produced in a variable and then use `ggsave` to save the plot on your machine.\nSave the plot in a dedicated plot directory in your RStudio project. \n\nNote: Make sure the path where you save the image exists. If you e.g. want to save in\n`img/`, then you first have to create the `img` folder in your project directory.\nFor this you can use the Files pane of RStudio.\n\n### References\n\nHorst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data.
