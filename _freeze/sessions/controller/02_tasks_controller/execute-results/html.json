To get it, you have to:\n\n- Install the package with `install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")`\n- Load the package at the beginning of your script with `library(palmerpenguins)`\n\nThe data set is called `penguins`:\n\n- The data set is available after you loaded the package\n- Just type `penguins` in the console and you should see the `penguins` tibble\n- Find a description of the variables in the help page `?penguins`\n\nTake a moment to get familiar with the data set and its variables.\n\n## 3 Exploratory plotting\n\nExplore the data set and it's variables with ggplot. \nBelow, you find some suggestions for plots. \nYou can start with the plot type your are most interested in and then continue from there.\nYou don't have to finish all the plots\nIf you have your own ideas for interesting plots with the penguin data set, \nfeel free to do them instead of the tasks. \n\nIn the exploratory section, don't worry about the beauty of your plots. \nThis task is about exploring the data and testing different visualization options in ggplot. \n\n### 3.1 Relationship between bill length and bill depth (scatterplot)\n\nWhat is the relationship between bill length and bill depth?\n\n- Create a scatterplot with bill length on the x-axis and bill depth on the y-axis\n- Can you add a regression line?\n- Add species as color aesthetic. Does your interpretation of the data change?\n  - What is the difference between adding color as a global aesthetic or as a local aesthetic of the point layer?\n- Add species as shape aesthetic to distinguish the species\n    \n### 3.2 Difference in flipper length between species (boxplot)\n\nIs there a difference in flipper length between the species?\n\n- Create a boxplot of the flipper length (y-axis) for the different species (x-axis)\n- Try adding notches to the boxplots\n- **Extra:** Add a layer with `geom_point()`. \nTry setting `position = position_jitter()` as argument in the point layer. What does it do?\n\n### 3.3 Differences between body mass of male and female penguins (boxplot)\n\nAre male penguins heavier than female penguins? And is this different between the 3 species?\n\n- Create a boxplot with body mass on the y axis and sex on the x axis\n- Add the difference between penguin species to this plot. Try the different options ggplot offers\n  - Species as color aesthetic\n  - Species as fill aesthetic\n  - Species as facet using `facet_wrap`\n- **Extra:** What happens if you use `geom_violin` instead of `geom_boxplot`? Can you combine both geoms in one plot?\n\n### 3.4 Distribution of flipper length between species (histogram)\n\nMake a histogram of the the flipper length separated by species.\n\nTry different methods of separating the species (color or facet).\n\nCompare stacked and overlapping histograms.\n\n### 3.5 Penguin flipper length by species and sex (heatmap)\n\nCreate a heat map that shows:\n\n- The categories sex and species on x- and y-axis\n- The flipper length as color\n\n### References\n\nHorst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data.

First, do 2 from each category before you do the remaining ones. You don't have to finish all the tasks but make sure you covered each category. Generally, the first tasks from a category are easier than the last tasks of a category.\n\n**Find all penguins that ...**\n\n1. ... have a bill length between 40 and 45 mm.\n\n2. ... for which we know the sex.\n\n3. ... which are of the species Adelie or Gentoo and live either on Dream or on Torgersen\n\n4. ... lived on the island Dream in the year 2007. How many of them were from each of the 3 species?\n\n**Count ...**\n\n1. ... the number of penguins on each island.\n\n2. ... the number of penguins of each species on each island.\n\n**Select ...**\n\n1. ... only the variables species, sex and year\n\n2. ... variables based on the following vector\n\n::: {.cell hash='02_tasks_controller_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_96b1c83c101b3b0914e39dd32f7ec4e7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncols <- c(\"species\", \"bill_length_mm\", \"flipper_length_mm\", \"body_mass_kg\")\n```\n:::\n\n3. ... only columns that contain measurements in mm\n\n**Add a column ...**\n\n1. ... with the ratio of bill length to bill depth\n\n2. ... with abbreviations for the species (Adelie = A, Gentoo = G, Chinstrap = C).\n\n\n**Calculate ...**\n\n1. ... mean flipper length and body mass for the 3 species and male and female penguins separately\n\n2. Can you do the same but remove the penguins for which we don't know the sex first?\n\n---\n\n## Extras\n\n1. Make a boxplot of penguin body mass with sex on the x-axis and facets for the different species. Can you remove the penguins with missing values for sex first?\n\n2. Make a scatterplot with the ratio of bill length to bill depth on the y axis and flipper length on the x axis? Can you distinguish the point between male and female penguins and remove penguins with unknown sex before making the plot?\n",
