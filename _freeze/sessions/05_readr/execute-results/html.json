Instead, make the \"\" to start writing the path and then us the tab key on your keyboard to auto-complete.\n\n:::\n\n## Extra\n\n- Navigate to your `data/` folder using the **Files pane** of RStudio.\nClick on the `.csv` file that you just saved there. What can you do? Try the **Import Dataset** button and see what you can do there.\n\n- Try reading some `xlsx` or `csv` tables that you have on your machine into R\n  - First copy the table into the `data/` folder in your project, then use the appropiate function to read in the data\n\n",
