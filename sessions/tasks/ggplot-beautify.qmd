## 1 Beautify the plots

First, choose one of the tasks 1.1 or 1.2, then do task 2 on saving plots. If you still have time, you can come back to the task you didnâ€™t do.

But also here, if you have other ideas, feel free to deviate from the tasks.

### 1.1 Beautify the plots from Task 1

Take the plot from before that you liked the most and try to make them look nicer.

Here's a list of ideas:

- Add a theme layer
- Customize the theme, e.g.
  - Change the position of the legend
  - Make the axis titles bold
- Change the color/fill scale of the plot
  - Use `scale_color_manual` or `scale_fill_manual`
  - Try `scale_color_viridis_d()` or `scale_fill_viridis_d()` with different options
  - Try a color scale from the `paletteer` package
    - First you have to install the package, then have a look at the [available palettes](https://r-charts.com/color-palettes)
- Change the labels of the x- and y-axis and add a title to the plot
- Make the points transparent, give them a different shape, ...

### 1.2 Can you reproduce this plot?

Take a look at this plot:

```{r fig.cap="Visualization from the [palmerpenguins package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("sessions/slides/img/figs-penguin/README-flipper-bill-1.png"))
```

It is similar to the one from Task 1-3.1 but more beautiful.
Can you reproduce this plot?

The colors that are used are:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
penguin_cols <- c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")
```

## 2 Save one of the plots on your machine

Save one of the plots you produced in a variable and then use `ggsave` to save the plot on your machine.
Save the plot in a dedicated plot directory in your RStudio project. 

Note: Make sure the path where you save the image exists. If you e.g. want to save in
`img/`, then you first have to create the `img` folder in your project directory.
For this you can use the Files pane of RStudio.
