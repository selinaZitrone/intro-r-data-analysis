## Change settings

Before you get started, there is an important setting that you should change in RStudio.
By default, RStudio will save the workspace of your current session in an `.Rdata` file. This would allow you to start the next session exactly where you left it by loading the `.Rdata` file.

This is not a good default. We always want to start R from a clean slate to ensure reproducibility and minimize error potential.

In RStudio go to **Tools -> Global Options -> General** and 

- Remove the check mark for "Restore .RData into workspace at startup"
- **Never** "Save workspace to .RData on exit"

```{r fig.height=20}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("sessions/tasks/img/setting_workspace.png"))
```

## Create an RStudio project

Create an RStudio project for all the scripts, notes, data, etc. from this workshop:

1. Create a project in a directory of your choice following the instructions from the slides
2. Use the **Files pane** in RStudio to create a basic folder structure in your project which will be filled with files in the next days
  - Folder `data/` for all data files 
  - Folder `R/` for all R scripts
  - Folder `docs/` for other documents (e.g. lecture notes or slides)
  - You can always change the structure of your project later

You can add files to your project either directly in RStudio, or in the file explorer of your operating system.

## Add an R script to the project

- Create a new R script and save it in the `R/` folder of your project
- Copy and paste the code from below into your script
  - Don't worry if you don't understand the code yet, we will learn all this later
- Run the code in the script line by line. Try both, running code using the **Run button** (in the top right corner of your script pane) and the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`
  - For each line that you run, observe what is happening to the different panes (console, environment, ...) in RStudio. Can you explain what is happening?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Look at the first lines of the iris dataset
head(iris)
# What is the iris dataset -> Call the help
?iris
# How many rows and columns does the data set have?
rownum <- nrow(iris)
colnum <- ncol(iris)
print(paste0("The iris dataset has ", rownum, " rows and ", colnum, " columns."))
# Some summary statistics on the iris data set
summary(iris)

# create a plot
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width,
  xlab = "Petal Length",
  ylab = "Petal Width",
  main = "Petal Width vs Petal Length",
  pch = 20,
  col = ifelse(iris$Species == "setosa", "coral1",
    ifelse(iris$Species == "virginica", "cyan4",
      ifelse(iris$Species == "versicolor",
        "darkgoldenrod2", "grey"
      )
    )
  )
)
# add a legend
legend("bottomright", c("setosa", "virginica", "versicolor"),
  col = c("coral1", "cyan4", "darkgoldenrod2"), pch = 20
)

```
