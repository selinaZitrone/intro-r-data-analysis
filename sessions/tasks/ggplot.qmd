## 1 Getting started

A helpful resource to consult for this task can be the [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).

Remember to put `library(tidyverse)` (or `library(ggplot2)`) on top of your script to access the ggplot functions.

## 2 Getting the data

To practice plotting with the `ggplot2` package, we will use a data set on 3 species of penguins on islands in Antarctica.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Artwork by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("sessions/tasks/img/lter_penguins.png"))
```

The data is available from the [palmerpenguins package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). To get it, you have to:

- Install the package with `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`
- Load the package at the beginning of your script with `library(palmerpenguins)`

The data set is called `penguins`:

- The data set is available after you loaded the package
- Just type `penguins` in the console and you should see the `penguins` tibble
- Find a description of the variables in the help page `?penguins`

Take a moment to get familiar with the data set and its variables.

## 3 Exploratory plotting

Explore the data set and it's variables with ggplot. 
Below, you find some suggestions for plots. 
You can start with the plot type your are most interested in and then continue from there.
You don't have to finish all the plots
If you have your own ideas for interesting plots with the penguin data set, 
feel free to do them instead of the tasks. 

In the exploratory section, don't worry about the beauty of your plots. 
This task is about exploring the data and testing different visualization options in ggplot. 

### 3.1 Relationship between bill length and bill depth (scatterplot)

What is the relationship between bill length and bill depth?

- Create a scatterplot with bill length on the x-axis and bill depth on the y-axis
- Can you add a regression line?
- Add species as color aesthetic. Does your interpretation of the data change?
  - What is the difference between adding color as a global aesthetic or as a local aesthetic of the point layer?
- Add species as shape aesthetic to distinguish the species
    
### 3.2 Difference in flipper length between species (boxplot)

Is there a difference in flipper length between the species?

- Create a boxplot of the flipper length (y-axis) for the different species (x-axis)
- Try adding notches to the boxplots
- **Extra:** Add a layer with `geom_point()`. 
Try setting `position = position_jitter()` as argument in the point layer. What does it do?

### 3.3 Differences between body mass of male and female penguins (boxplot)

Are male penguins heavier than female penguins? And is this different between the 3 species?

- Create a boxplot with body mass on the y axis and sex on the x axis
- Add the difference between penguin species to this plot. Try the different options ggplot offers
  - Species as color aesthetic
  - Species as fill aesthetic
  - Species as facet using `facet_wrap`
- **Extra:** What happens if you use `geom_violin` instead of `geom_boxplot`? Can you combine both geoms in one plot?

### 3.4 Distribution of flipper length between species (histogram)

Make a histogram of the the flipper length separated by species.

Try different methods of separating the species (color or facet).

Compare stacked and overlapping histograms.

### 3.5 Penguin flipper length by species and sex (heatmap)

Create a heat map that shows:

- The categories sex and species on x- and y-axis
- The flipper length as color
