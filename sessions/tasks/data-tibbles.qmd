## Getting started with tibbles

Before you start the task:

- Install the tibble package by calling `install.packages("tibble")` in the console.
- Open your script for the task and put `library(tibble)` on top
- Execute this line and the tibble package is loaded into your R session and ready to use

## Creating a tibble

Use the vectors `species`, `brainwt_kg`, `bodywt_kg` from before and combine them in a tibble.

## Exploring the tibble

Explore the tibble you created with the different functions that you learned in the presentation.
You can for example try 

- `view()` and explore what you can do in the view window that opens: searching, filtering, sorting columns
- `str()` to view the structure of the data
- `summary()`
- ...


## Indexing and selecting

Now let's try some indexing on the data.

Select

- Rows 1, 5, and 7 and the columns `species` and `bodywt_kg`
- select rows 1 to 10, all columns
- select the column `bodywt_kg` as a vector

---

## Extra

- Select the last column of the last row without using the row and column index (so don't use any numbers in this command)
- Calculate the mean of the `bodywt_kg` column and save it in a variable
- Add a new column to the data called `ratio_body_brain` with the ratio of the columns `bodywt_kg` and `brainwt_kg`
