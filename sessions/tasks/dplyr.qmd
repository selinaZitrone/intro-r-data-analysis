## Get started

A helpful resource for to consult for this task can be the [dplyr cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/data-transformation.pdf).

Before you start, make sure to load the `tidyverse` package and the `palmerpenguins` package.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Data transformation with dplyr

In the following, you find a lot of different data transformation tasks. First, do 1-2 from each category before you do the remaining ones. You don't have to finish all the tasks but make sure you covered each category. Generally, the first tasks from a category are easier than the last tasks of a category.

**Find all penguins that ...**

1. ... have a bill length between 40 and 45 mm.

2. ... for which we know the sex (sex is not `NA`).

3. ... which are of the species Adelie or Gentoo.

4. ... lived on the island Dream in the year 2007. How many of them were from each of the 3 species?

**Count ...**

1. ... the number of penguins on each island.

2. ... the number of penguins of each species on each island.

**Select ...**

1. ... only the variables species, sex and year

2. ... only columns that contain measurements in mm

**Add a column ...**

1. ... with the ratio of bill length to bill depth

2. ... with abbreviations for the species (Adelie = A, Gentoo = G, Chinstrap = C).


**Calculate ...**

1. ... mean flipper length and body mass for the 3 species and male and female penguins separately

2. ... Can you do the same but remove the penguins for which we don't know the sex first?

## Extras

1. Make a boxplot of penguin body mass with sex on the x-axis and facets for the different species. Can you remove the penguins with missing values for sex first?

2. Make a scatterplot with the ratio of bill length to bill depth on the y axis and flipper length on the x axis? Can you distinguish the point between male and female penguins and remove penguins with unknown sex before making the plot?
