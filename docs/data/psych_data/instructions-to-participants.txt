# Initial Instructions
### Character Strengths group --- Initial Instructions
#### UTas Happiness Study - Instructions

Dear Participant,

Thank you for participating in The Happiness Study at the University of Tasmania!

As you know, the study involves undertaking a happiness exercise for one week. We would like you to participate in a specific exercise that involves using your strengths in new ways.

The exercise involves identifying your top five character strengths. In order to identify your character strengths, we would like to ask you to fill in a questionnaire that has been developed by eminent scientists in the field. This questionnaire will accurately assess your top five character strengths and will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. Please click on the link below to access the questionnaire. If clicking the link does not work, please copy and paste it into your browser address bar.

Once you have completed the questionnaire you will be informed of your top five character strengths. These will also be emailed to you. Please take some time to read the description of each of your strengths. Your exercise involves you choosing one of your top five character strengths and then using it in a new and different way for each day of the next week.

At the end of week I will send you an email asking you to complete a follow-up questionnaire. If you complete all follow-up questionnaires, you will be entered in a lottery draw to win a prize. If you would like to discuss any aspect of this study please feel free to contact me at Happiness.Study@utas.edu.au. I am happy to discuss any aspect of the research with you.

### Gratitude Visit group --- Initial Instructions
#### UTas Happiness Study - Instructions

Dear Participant,

Thank you for participating in The Happiness Study at the University of Tasmania!

As you know, the study involves undertaking a happiness exercise for one week. The specific exercise which you have been allocated for the week involves selecting one important person from your past who has made a major positive difference in your life and to whom you have never fully expressed your thanks. Please do not confound this selection with new-found romantic love, or with the possibility of a future gain. Take your time to write a letter to this person, about 1 page in length. Invite that person to your home, or travel to that person's home- it is important that you deliver the letter face to face. Do not tell the person the purpose of the visit in advance; a simple "I just want to see you" will suffice. When you are both comfortable deliver your letter and let the other person react unhurriedly. Reminisce together about the concrete events that make this person so important to you.

At the end of week I will send you an email asking you to complete a follow-up questionnaire. If you complete all follow-up questionnaires, you will be entered in a lottery draw to win a prize. If you would like to discuss any aspect of this study please feel free to contact me at Happiness.Study@utas.edu.au. I am happy to discuss any aspect of the research with you.
