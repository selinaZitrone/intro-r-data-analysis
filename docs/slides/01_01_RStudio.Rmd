  R is the **programming language** and the **program** that does the actual work
    
  - can be use with many different programming environments (But RStudio is the best for R)

     ]
  
  RStudio is the **integrated development environment** (IDE)
   - provides an interface to R
   - specifically built around R code 
   - execute code
   - syntax highlighting
   - file and project management
   - ...

.content-box-grey[`r fa("arrow-right")` You can use R without RStudio but RStudio without R would be of very little use]

# Console pane

.pull-left[
- execute R code

- output from R code in scripts is printed there

- type command into the console and execute with `Enter/Return`

.content-box-yellow[`r fa("lightbulb")` Use arrow keys to bring back last commands

# Script pane

.pull-left[

- write scripts with R code

  - scripts are text files with R commands (file ending `.R`)
  
  - use scripts to save commands for reuse

# Script pane

.pull-left[

- create a new R script: <br> `File -> New File -> R Script`
- save an R script:<br> `File -> Save` (`Ctrl/Cmd + S`)
- run code line by line with `Run` button (`Ctrl + Enter/Cmd + Return`)
- you can open multiple scripts at the same time

.content-box-yellow[`r fa("lightbulb")` Use **scripts** for all your analysis and for commands that you want to save.]

.content-box-yellow[`r fa("lightbulb")` Use **console** for temporary commands, e.g. to test something.]

# Environment pane

.pull-left[
- shows objects currently present in the R session

- is empty if you start R

# Files pane

.pull-left[

- similar to Explorer/Finder

- browse project structure and files
  - find and open files
  - create new folders
  - delete files
  - rename files

# Plot pane

.pull-left[
- Plots that are created with R will be shown here

- You can export plots by clicking on export button
  - but better to do it by code

# Project oriented workflow with RStudio

.pull-left[
- one directory with all files relevant for project
  - scripts, data, plots, documents, ...
- an RStudio project is just a normal directory with an `*.Rproj` file

- advantages of using RStudio projects
    - easy to navigate in R Studio (`File` pane)
    - easy to find and access scripts in RStudio
    - project root is working directory
    - open multiple projects simultaneously in separate RStudio instances

# Create an RStudio project

.pull-left[
Create a project from scratch:
  
1. `File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project`
2. Enter a directory name (this will be the name of your project)
3. Choose the Directory where the project should be initiated
4. `Create Project`

RStudio will now create and open the project for you.
