# Before we get started I

Any feedback and questions are very welcome.

I am curious to know

- What you liked/disliked
- Which topics or methods you missed
- Which tasks were too easy/too difficult or just right
- ...

---

# Before we get started II

I assume that you already know things like:

- Creating new projects or documents in RStudio
- Basic functionality of RStudio e.g. Console vs. Script, etc.
- Basics of R: concept of variables, functions, packages, ...

--

- Also, I will use some (but very few) code examples where I use functions from
the `tidyverse` packages (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`)

--

But we probably have very different R skills and levels in the group, so 
**please ask if anything needs more explanation**
