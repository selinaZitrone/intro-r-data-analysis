By default, RStudio will save an the workspace of your current session in an .Rdata file. This would allow you to start the next session exactly where you left by loading this .Rdata file.\r\nThis is not a good default. We always want to start R from a clean slate to ensure reproducibility and minimize error potential.\r\nIn RStudio go to Tools -> Global Options -> General and set the following workspace options:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 Create an RStudio project\r\nCreate an RStudio project that you can use for all the scripts, notes, data, etc. from this workshop.\r\nCreate a project in a directory of your choice following the instructions from the slides\r\nUse the File pane in RStudio to create a basic folder structure in your project which will be filled with files in the next days\r\ne.g. create folders for data, scripts, documents,…\r\nyou can always change the structure of your project later, but for now, we want some basic folders that we can navigate\r\n\r\nNow close the project\r\nFind the project your computer’s file explorer and open it\r\nYou can add files to your project either directly in RStudio, or in the file explorer of your operating system.\r\n1.3 Add an R script to the project\r\ncreate a new R script, save it in the appropriate folder of your project (e.g. scripts or R)\r\ncopy paste the code from below into your script\r\ndon’t worry if you don’t understand the code yet, we will learn all this later\r\n\r\nrun the code in the script line by line. Try both, running code using the Run button and the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Enter/Return\r\nfor each line that you run, observe what is happening to the other panes (console, environment, …) in RStudio. Can you explain what is happening?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Look at the first lines of the iris dataset\r\nhead(iris)\r\n# What is the iris dataset -> Call the help\r\n?iris\r\n# How many rows and columns does the data set have?\r\nrownum <- nrow(iris)\r\ncolnum <- ncol(iris)\r\nprint(paste0(\"The iris dataset has \", rownum, \" rows and \", colnum, \" columns.\"))\r\n# Some summary statistics on the iris data set\r\nsummary(iris)\r\n\r\n# create a plot\r\nplot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, \r\n     xlab = \"Petal Length\",\r\n     ylab = \"Petal Width\",\r\n     main = \"Petal Width vs Petal Length\",\r\n     pch = 20,\r\n     col=ifelse(iris$Species == \"setosa\",\"coral1\", \r\n                ifelse(iris$Species == \"virginica\",\"cyan4\", \r\n                       ifelse(iris$Species ==  \"versicolor\",\r\n                              \"darkgoldenrod2\", \"grey\"))))\r\n# add a legend\r\nlegend(\"bottomright\", c(\"setosa\",\"virginica\", \"versicolor\"),\r\n       col = c(\"coral1\",\"cyan4\", \"darkgoldenrod2\"), pch=20)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Vectors in R\r\nAims:\r\nLearn about type conversion\r\nWork with vectors\r\nCreate a new script for the code of this task. Use comments in your code to take notes.\r\n2.1 Type conversion\r\nLook at the vectors below. What do you think will happen?\r\n\r\n\r\nv1 <- c(1, \"a\", 2, 3)\r\nv2 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, 1, FALSE, 0)\r\nv3 <- c(0, \"23\", 5, 7)\r\nv4 <- c(4L, 6L, 23.5345)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy the vectors to your script and check out the data types of the vectors using typeof.\r\nTry to explicitly convert the vectors to integer and to character. What happens?\r\n2.2 Working with vectors\r\nYou have the following vectors:\r\nspecies: name of species\r\nbodywt_kg: body weight of the species in kg\r\nbrainwt_g: brain weight of the species in kg\r\n\r\n\r\nspecies <- c(\r\n  \"MountainBeaver\", \"Cow\", \"GreyWolf\", \"Goat\",\r\n  \"GuineaPig\", \"Diplodocus\", \"AsianElephant\", \"Donkey\",\r\n  \"Horse\", \"PotarMonkey\", \"Cat\", \"Giraffe\",\r\n  \"Gorilla\", \"Human\", \"AfricanElephant\", \"Triceratops\",\r\n  \"RhesusMonkey\", \"Kangaroo\", \"GoldenHamster\", \"Mouse\",\r\n  \"Rabbit\", \"Sheep\", \"Jaguar\", \"Chimpanzee\",\r\n  \"Rat\", \"Brachiosaurus\", \"Mole\", \"Pig\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nbodywt_kg <- c(\r\n  1.4, 465, 36.3, 27.7, 1., 11700, 2547, 187.1,\r\n  521, 10, 3.3, 529, 207, 62, 6654, 9400,\r\n  6.8, 35, 0.1, 0.02, 2.5, 55.5, 100, 52.2,\r\n  0.3, 87000, 0.1, 192\r\n)\r\n\r\nbrainwt_g <- c(\r\n  8.1, 423, 119.5, 115, 5.5, 50, 4603, 419, 655, 115, 25.6,\r\n  680, 406, 1320, 5712, 70, 179, 56, 1, 0.4, 12.1, 175,\r\n  157, 440, 1.9, 154.5, 3, 180\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTasks\r\nCheck if the following animals are contained in the data set:\r\n\r\n\r\nanimals_to_check <- c(\"Snail\", \"Goat\", \"Chimpanzee\", \"Rat\", \"Dragon\", \"Eagle\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvert brain weight from g to kg and save result it in a new vector brainwt_kg\r\nCalculate the mean brain weight\r\nWhat is the ratio of brain weight to body weight in percent? Calculate it and save the result in a new vector\r\nAre there any animals with a larger brain to body ratio than humans? If yes, which ones?\r\nHint: extract human ratio and save it in a variable first\r\n\r\nExtras\r\nRound the ratio values to 4 decimal places with the round function\r\nhave a look at ?round to check out how to use it\r\n\r\nWhich animal has the smallest brain to body ratio?\r\nAdd the following three animals to the data vectors\r\n\r\n\r\nspecies_new <- c(\"Eagle\", \"Snail\", \"Lion\")\r\nbrainwt_g_new <- c(40, NA, 500)\r\nbodywt_kg_new <- c(18, 0.01, 550)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow calculate the mean brain weight again. Can you explain what happens? Can you fix it?\r\nhint: have a look at ?mean\r\n\r\n3 Tibbles in R\r\nAims:\r\nCreate and manipulate tibbles with base R:\r\nindexing\r\nadding columns\r\nchanging values\r\n\r\n3.1 Getting started with tibbles\r\nBefore you start the task:\r\nInstall the tibble package by calling install.packages(\"tibble\") in the console.\r\nOpen your script for the task and put library(tibble) on top\r\nExecute this line and the tibble package is loaded into your R session and ready to use\r\n3.2 Creating a tibble\r\nUse the vectors species, brainwt_kg, bodywt_kg from the last task and combine them in a tibble.\r\nAdd the following 3 columns to this tibble:\r\nThe ratio of brain weight to body weight\r\nA column that indicates whether an animal has a large or a small brain\r\nPut the string \"large\" into this column if the brain-body weight ratio is higher than 1%\r\nElse put \"small\" into the column\r\n\r\nThe order of the animals to the data:\r\n\r\n\r\norder <- c(\r\n  \"Rodentia\", \"Artiodactyla\", \"Carnivora\", \"Artiodactyla\", \"Rodentia\", NA,\r\n  \"Proboscidea\", rep(\"Perissodactyla\", 2), NA, \"Carnivora\", \"Artiodactyla\",\r\n  rep(\"Primates\", 2), \"Proboscidea\", \"Ornithischia\", \"Primates\", \"Diprotodontia\",\r\n  \"Rodentia\", \"Rodentia\", \"Lagomorpha\", \"Artiodactyla\", \"Carnivora\", \"Primates\",\r\n  \"Rodentia\", NA, \"Eulipotyphla\", \"Artiodactyla\"\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.3 Exploring the tibble\r\nExplore the tibble you created with the different function that you learned in the presentation. You can for example try\r\nview() and explore what you can do in the view window that opens: searching, filtering, sorting columns\r\nstr() to view the structure of the data\r\nsummary()\r\n…\r\n3.4 Indexing\r\nNow let’s try some indexing on our data.\r\nTry the following selections\r\nrows 1, 5, and 7 and the columns species and bodywt_kg\r\nselect rows 1 to 10, all columns\r\nselect the last column of the last row without using the row and column index (so don’t use any numbers in this command)\r\nselect only rows that belong to the order of primates, rodentia and carnivora\r\nNow, create two subsets of the data: one for the small brained animals and one for the large brained animals. To create the subset, you can use the new column with the brain size category that you added before.\r\nCalculate the mean and the standard deviation (sd()) of the brain to body ratio for both subsets.\r\n\r\nReference\r\nWolfram Research, “Sample Data: Animal Weights” from the Wolfram Data Repository (2016) https://doi.org/10.24097/wolfram.43616.data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
