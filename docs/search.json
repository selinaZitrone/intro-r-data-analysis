By default, RStudio will save the workspace of your current session in an .Rdata file. This would allow you to start the next session exactly where you left it by loading the .Rdata file.\r\nThis is not a good default. We always want to start R from a clean slate to ensure reproducibility and minimize error potential.\r\nIn RStudio go to Tools -> Global Options -> General and\r\nRemove the check mark for “Restore .RData into workspace at startup”\r\nNever save workspace to .RData on exit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 Create an RStudio project\r\nCreate an RStudio project for all the scripts, notes, data, etc. from this workshop.\r\nCreate a project in a directory of your choice following the instructions from the slides\r\nUse the File pane in RStudio to create a basic folder structure in your project which will be filled with files in the next days\r\nE.g. create the folders data, R, documents,…\r\nYou can always change the structure of your project later, but for now, we want some basic folders that we can navigate\r\n\r\nYou can add files to your project either directly in RStudio, or in the file explorer of your operating system.\r\n1.3 Add an R script to the project\r\nCreate a new R script and save it in the appropriate folder of your project (e.g. scripts or R)\r\nCopy and paste the code from below into your script\r\nDon’t worry if you don’t understand the code yet, we will learn all this later\r\n\r\nRun the code in the script line by line. Try both, running code using the Run button (in the top right corner of your script pane) and the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Enter/Return\r\nF or each line that you run, observe what is happening to the other panes (console, environment, …) in RStudio. Can you explain what is happening?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Look at the first lines of the iris dataset\r\nhead(iris)\r\n# What is the iris dataset -> Call the help\r\n?iris\r\n# How many rows and columns does the data set have?\r\nrownum <- nrow(iris)\r\ncolnum <- ncol(iris)\r\nprint(paste0(\"The iris dataset has \", rownum, \" rows and \", colnum, \" columns.\"))\r\n# Some summary statistics on the iris data set\r\nsummary(iris)\r\n\r\n# create a plot\r\nplot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width,\r\n  xlab = \"Petal Length\",\r\n  ylab = \"Petal Width\",\r\n  main = \"Petal Width vs Petal Length\",\r\n  pch = 20,\r\n  col = ifelse(iris$Species == \"setosa\", \"coral1\",\r\n    ifelse(iris$Species == \"virginica\", \"cyan4\",\r\n      ifelse(iris$Species == \"versicolor\",\r\n        \"darkgoldenrod2\", \"grey\"\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n)\r\n# add a legend\r\nlegend(\"bottomright\", c(\"setosa\", \"virginica\", \"versicolor\"),\r\n  col = c(\"coral1\", \"cyan4\", \"darkgoldenrod2\"), pch = 20\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Data types and vectors\r\n\r\n\r\n  addClassKlippyTo(\"pre.r, pre.markdown\");\r\n  addKlippy('right', 'top', 'auto', '1', 'Copy code', 'Copied!');\r\n\r\nCreate a new script in your RStudio project for this task. Use comments in your code to take notes.\r\n2.1 Type conversion\r\nLook at the vectors below. What do you think will happen? Which data type do they have?\r\n\r\n\r\nv1 <- c(1, \"a\", 2, 3)\r\nv2 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, 1, FALSE, 0)\r\nv3 <- c(4L, 6L, 23.5345)\r\nv4 <- c(TRUE, \"a\", FALSE, \"FALSE\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2 Working with vectors\r\nYou have the following three vectors:\r\nspecies: name of the species\r\nbodywt_kg: body weight of the species in kg\r\nbrainwt_g: brain weight of the species in g\r\n\r\n\r\nspecies <- c(\r\n  \"MountainBeaver\", \"Cow\", \"GreyWolf\", \"Goat\",\r\n  \"GuineaPig\", \"Diplodocus\", \"AsianElephant\", \"Donkey\",\r\n  \"Horse\", \"PotarMonkey\", \"Cat\", \"Giraffe\",\r\n  \"Gorilla\", \"Human\", \"AfricanElephant\", \"Triceratops\",\r\n  \"RhesusMonkey\", \"Kangaroo\", \"GoldenHamster\", \"Mouse\",\r\n  \"Rabbit\", \"Sheep\", \"Jaguar\", \"Chimpanzee\",\r\n  \"Rat\", \"Brachiosaurus\", \"Mole\", \"Pig\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nbodywt_kg <- c(\r\n  1.4, 465, 36.3, 27.7, 1., 11700, 2547, 187.1,\r\n  521, 10, 3.3, 529, 207, 62, 6654, 9400,\r\n  6.8, 35, 0.1, 0.02, 2.5, 55.5, 100, 52.2,\r\n  0.3, 87000, 0.1, 192\r\n)\r\n\r\nbrainwt_g <- c(\r\n  8.1, 423, 119.5, 115, 5.5, 50, 4603, 419, 655, 115, 25.6,\r\n  680, 406, 1320, 5712, 70, 179, 56, 1, 0.4, 12.1, 175,\r\n  157, 440, 1.9, 154.5, 3, 180\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the vectos into your R script and solve the following tasks.\r\nTasks\r\nCheck which of the following animals are contained in the species vector:\r\n\r\n\r\nanimals_to_check <- c(\"Snail\", \"Goat\", \"Chimpanzee\", \"Rat\", \"Dragon\", \"Eagle\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConvert brain weight from g to kg and save the result in a new vector brainwt_kg\r\nCalculate mean and standard deviation of the brain weight\r\nHint: have a look at the summary slides to find the functions\r\n\r\nWhich species have a brain weight larger than the mean brain weight of all species?\r\nCalculate the ratio of brain weight to body weight in percent for all animals and save the result in a new vector\r\nAre there any animals with a larger brain to body weight ratio than humans? If yes, which ones?\r\nHint: calculate the ratio for humans and save it in a separate variable first\r\n\r\nExtras\r\nRound the ratio vector to 4 decimal places with the round function\r\nType ?round into the console to open the help of the round function\r\n\r\nWhich animal has the smallest brain to body weight ratio?\r\nHint: have a look at the min function\r\n\r\nAdd the following three animals to the data vectors\r\n\r\n\r\nspecies_new <- c(\"Eagle\", \"Snail\", \"Lion\")\r\nbrainwt_g_new <- c(40, NA, 500)\r\nbodywt_kg_new <- c(18, 0.01, 550)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow calculate the mean brain weight again. Can you explain what happens? Can you fix it?\r\nHint: have a look at ?mean\r\n\r\n3 Tibbles\r\n3.1 Getting started with tibbles\r\nBefore you start the task:\r\nInstall the tibble package by calling install.packages(\"tibble\") in the console.\r\nOpen your script for the task and put library(tibble) on top\r\nExecute this line and the tibble package is loaded into your R session and ready to use\r\n3.2 Creating a tibble\r\nUse the vectors species, brainwt_kg, bodywt_kg from before and combine them in a tibble.\r\n3.3 Exploring the tibble\r\nExplore the tibble you created with the different functions that you learned in the presentation. You can for example try\r\nview() and explore what you can do in the view window that opens: searching, filtering, sorting columns\r\nstr() to view the structure of the data\r\nsummary()\r\n…\r\n3.4 Indexing and selecting\r\nNow let’s try some indexing on the data.\r\nSelect\r\nRows 1, 5, and 7 and the columns species and bodywt_kg\r\nselect rows 1 to 10, all columns\r\nselect the column bodywt_kg as a vector\r\nExtra\r\nSelect the last column of the last row without using the row and column index (so don’t use any numbers in this command)\r\nCalculate the mean of the bodywt_kg column and save it in a variable\r\nAdd a new column to the data called ratio_body_brain with the ratio of the columns bodywt_kg and brainwt_kg\r\n\r\n4 Reading and writing tibbles\r\n3.1 Getting started with readr and the tidyverse\r\nBefore you start, make sure to install the tidyverse packages by calling\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will install readr along with other tidyverse packages.\r\nRemember to put library(tidyverse) (or library(readr)) on top of your script to access the readr functions.\r\n3.2 Write a tibble to disk\r\nLet’s use the animals tibble from the previous task and write it into the data folder in our project.\r\nBefore writing the tibble\r\nCreate a data sub-directory in your RStudio project (if you don’t have one yet)\r\nHint: You can do that from within RStudio by using the New Folder button in the Files pane\r\n\r\nNow write the animals tibble to that /data sub-directory as animals.csv using a comma separator.\r\nCheck if the file was written into the correct folder.\r\n3.3 Read data into R\r\nNow, try to read the data set back into R using the appropriate read_* function.\r\nExtra\r\nNavigate to your data directory using the Files pane of RStudio. Click on both the .csv file that you just saved there. What can you do? Try the Import Dataset button and see what you can do there.\r\n\r\nReference\r\nWolfram Research, “Sample Data: Animal Weights” from the Wolfram Data Repository (2016) https://doi.org/10.24097/wolfram.43616.data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To get it, you have to:\r\nInstall the package with install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\r\nLoad the package at the beginning of your script with library(palmerpenguins)\r\nAfter you have done that, take a moment to get familiar with the data set and its variables. The data set is called penguins:\r\nThe data set is available after you loaded the package\r\nJust type penguins in the console and you should see the penguins tibble\r\n1.3 Exploratory plotting\r\nExplore the data set and it’s variables with ggplot. Below, you find some ideas and tasks for plots. I suggest you start with one of them and if you want you can continue. But if you have your own ideas for interesting plots with the penguin data set, feel free to do them instead of continuing with the tasks.\r\nIn the exploratory section, don’t care too much about the beauty of your plots and just use the default theme and colors. This is about exploring the data and testing different visualization options in ggplot.\r\n1.3.1 Relationship between bill length and bill depth (scatterplot)\r\nWhat is the relationship between bill length and bill depth?\r\nCreate a scatterplot with bill length on the x-axis and bill depth on the y-axis\r\nCan you add a regression line?\r\nAdd species as color aesthetic. Does your interpretation of the data change?\r\nWhat is the difference between adding color as a global aesthetic or as a local aesthetic of the point layer?\r\n\r\nAdd species as shape aesthetic to distinguish the species\r\n1.3.2 Difference in flipper length between species (boxplot)\r\nIs there a difference in flipper length between the species?\r\nCreate a boxplot of the flipper length (y-axis) for the different species (x-axis)\r\nTry adding notches to the boxplots by setting notch = TRUE in the boxplot layer\r\nExtra: Add a layer with geom_point(). Try setting position = position_jitter() as argument in the point layer. What does it do?\r\n1.3.3 Differences between body mass of male and female penguins (boxplot)\r\nAre male penguins heavier than female penguins? And is this different between the 3 species?\r\nCreate a boxplot with body mass on the y axis and sex on the x axis\r\nAdd the difference between penguin species to this plot. Try the different options ggplot offers\r\nSpecies as color aesthetic\r\nSpecies as fill aesthetic\r\nSpecies as facet using facet_wrap\r\n\r\nExtra: What happens if you use geom_violin instead of geom_boxplot? Can you combine both geoms in one plot?\r\n1.4 Beautify the plots\r\nAlso here: Chose the tasks that you like most.\r\n1.4.1 Beautify the plots from 1.3\r\nTake the plot from before that you liked the most and try to make them look nicer.\r\nHere’s a list of ideas:\r\nAdd a theme layer\r\nCustomize the theme, e.g.\r\nChange the position of the legend\r\nMake the axis titles bold\r\n\r\nChange the color/fill scale of the plot\r\nUse scale_color_manual or scale_fill_manual\r\nTry scale_color_viridis_d() or scale_fill_viridis_d() with different options\r\nTry a color scale from an additional package, e.g. ggsci::scale_color_uchicago() or ggsci::scale_fill_uchicago()\r\nFirst you have to install the ggsci package\r\n\r\n\r\nChange the labels of the x- and y-axis and add a title to the plot\r\n…\r\n1.4.2 Can you reproduce this plot?\r\nTake a look at the plot, we discussed during the presentation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Visualization from the palmerpenguins package\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you reproduce this plot? It is similar to the one from Task 1.3.1.\r\nThe colors that are used are:\r\n\r\n\r\npenguin_cols <- c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.5 Save one of the plots on your machine\r\nSave one of the plots you produced in a variable and then use ggsave to save the plot on your machine. Save the plot in a dedicated plot directory in your RStudio project.\r\nReferences\r\nHorst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data.

First, do 2 from each category before you do the remaining ones. You don’t have to finish all the tasks but make sure you covered each category. Generally, the first tasks from a category are easier than the last tasks of a category.\r\nFind all penguins that …\r\n… have a bill length between 40 and 45 mm.\r\n… for which we know the sex.\r\n… which are of the species Adelie or Gentoo and live either on Dream or on Torgersen\r\n… lived on the island Dream in the year 2007. How many of them were from each of the 3 species?\r\nCount …\r\n… the number of penguins on each island.\r\n… the number of penguins of each species on each island.\r\nSort …\r\n… penguins to find penguins with lowest body mass\r\n… penguins to find penguins with highest body mass\r\n… penguins by species and sex, with longest flippers first\r\nSelect …\r\n… only the variables species, sex and year\r\n… variables based on the following vector\r\n\r\n\r\ncols <- c(\"species\", \"bill_length_mm\", \"flipper_length_mm\", \"body_mass_kg\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n… only columns that contain measurements in mm\r\nAdd a column …\r\n… with the ratio of bill length to bill depth\r\n… with abbreviations for the species (Adelie = A, Gentoo = G, Chinstrap = C).\r\nCalculate …\r\n… mean flipper length and body mass for the 3 species and male and female penguins separately\r\nCan you do the same but remove the penguins for which we don’t know the sex first?\r\nExtras\r\nMake a boxplot of penguin body mass with sex on the x-axis and facets for the different species. Can you remove the penguins with missing values for sex first?\r\nMake a scatterplot with the ratio of bill length to bill depth on the y axis and flipper length on the x axis? Can you distinguish the point between male and female penguins and remove penguins with unknown sex before making the plot?\r\n\r\n3 tidyr\r\n4.1 Getting started with tidyr\r\nBefore you start, make sure to load the tidyverse package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.2 Let’s tidy some data sets\r\nFirst, complete all the tasks before you move to the extras.\r\n1. relig_incom\r\nHave a look at the relig_income data set that is included in tidyverse package. The data set contains the results of a survey asking people about their religion and income category.\r\nWhat is not tidy about this data set? Can you fix it?\r\n2. billboard\r\nHave a look at the billboard data set that is included in the tidyverse package. The data set contains information about the chart rank of songs in the year 2000.\r\nWhat is not tidy about this data set? Can you fix it?\r\nExtras\r\nCheck out the values_drop_na argument of pivot_longer. What does it do and how can you use it here?\r\nCheck out the names_prefix argument of pivot_longer. What does it do and how can you use it here?\r\n3. fish_encounters\r\nHave a look at the fish_encounters data set that is included in the tidyverse package. The data set contains records of fish detected by different automatic monitoring stations. Check out summary(fish_encounters) - the column seen only contains values of 1 to indicate that the fish was seen at the respective station.\r\nWhat is not tidy about this data set? Can you fix it?\r\nExtra\r\nHave a look at the values_fill argument of pivot_wider. How could you use it in this case to replace the missing values that are created?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Make sure you install it once and then load it:\r\n\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(\"performance\")\r\nlibrary(performance)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe performance package depends on other packages. It might happen that you encounter an error when trying to load or use the package for the first time. Just read the error message and install the missing packages with install.packages() (likely this will be the case for the qqplotr package).\r\nNote: Finish all the tasks (1.2-1.4) first before you start with the extras.\r\n2.2 Linear regression\r\nLet’s start with a simple linear regression.\r\nDoes the bill depth depend on bill length?\r\nMake a scatter plot of bill length on the x and bill depth on the y axis.\r\nNow:\r\nFit a linear model to test this relationship\r\nCheck for significant effects: What do the results mean?\r\nCheck the model assumptions using diagnostic plots\r\nWhat do you think? Are the assumptions violated or do the plots look okay?\r\nCan you add the regression line to the scatter plot?\r\n2.3 Analysis of covariance\r\nDoes the relationship between bill length and bill depth differ between penguin species?\r\nAdd the species variable as color aesthetic to the scatter plot from 1.2\r\nFit the linear model again, including species as second explanatory variable\r\nFit a model without interaction between species and bill length\r\n\r\nTest model assumptions the both model\r\nCheck for significant effects models\r\nAdd the regression lines to the plot\r\nExtra\r\nNow fit a model with interaction between species and bill length. Test assumptions and significant effects also for this model. Which model would you choose? The one with or without interaction?\r\nWhich model would you choose? It the model results in the scatter plot from before.\r\n2.4 Anova\r\nDo the weight of penguins depend on sex and species?\r\nBefore you start exploring this question, remove penguins with missing sex variable from the data\r\nThink of a plot that can represent this question and plot it\r\nFit a linear model that represents this question (with interaction between sex and species)\r\nTest for significant predictors\r\nTest model assumptions\r\nExtra\r\nImprove the looks of the Anova result plot. You can be as creative as you want, e.g. take inspiration from plots you saw in the presentation.\r\nSome ideas:\r\nMake a boxplot and try to add a combination of geom_point() and position = position_jitterdodge()\r\nA bit tricky: Summarize the data (calculate mean and standard deviation) grouped by species and sex. The plot points + errorbars for mean + sd. Have a look here to see how you can do this.\r\nSame as above but with bars instead of points to represent means\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
