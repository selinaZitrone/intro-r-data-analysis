As we progress in the workshop, we will incorporate more options, functionality and formatting into the document.\r\nArtwork by Allison HorstThe data is available from the palmerpenguins package. To get it, you have to open RStudio and:\r\nInstall the package with install.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\r\nTake a moment to get familiar with the data set and its variables:\r\nLoad the package into your R session with library(palmerpenguins) (just do this in the console)\r\nType penguins in the console and you should see the penguins tibble\r\nIt contains data on bill and flipper size, weight and sex of the 3 penguin species\r\nWe will need the data later, so remember that you can access via the variable penguins.\r\n1.2 Create first rmarkdown document\r\nFor all tasks of today, you might find it helpful, to open the R Markdown cheat sheet for reference.\r\nStart by creating a new .Rmd file:\r\nGo to File -> New File -> R Markdown... and\r\nChose HTML as default output format from the Document section (This should be already selected as default)\r\nIf you want, you can already enter a title and author\r\nCreate and save the file in a convenient location on your machine.\r\nBefore you start working with the document:\r\nKnit the document to see what happens\r\nTry the Knit button on top of your document or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K\r\nChose different output formats to knit to by clicking on the little black arrow next to the Knit button\r\n\r\n1.2 Add some text\r\nNow start writing your very own paper about the 3 penguins.\r\nFirst, remove all template text from the document except the YAML header and the first code chunk (we will learn later what that does).\r\nBefore you start writing, have a quick look at the Example text that I show below. It is the one we discussed together just now and includes many different markdown formatting elements and some text about the penguin data set.\r\nNow write a text yourself.\r\nYou can either reproduce my text and use copy paste to type less, or you can write your own text about penguins (or anything else you want to write about).\r\nThe important thing in this task is to include many different markdown formatting elements.\r\nYou can find the links that I used in the text in the Links section or by right clicking on the text\r\nDuring the writing process, don’t forget to knit your document often. It’s easier to fix mistakes and error messages if you detect them early.\r\n\r\nExample text\r\nThe penguins of Antarctica\r\nSelina Baldauf\r\n25/03/2022\r\nIntroduction\r\nThere are three main penguin species in Antarctica (Chinstrap, Gentoo, Adelie). You can see them in the following figure:\r\nArtwork by Allison HorstIn this paper we want to answer the following questions\r\nHow does bill depth depend on bill length?\r\nWhich penguin species has the highest body mass?\r\nMethods\r\nThe data\r\nThe data was collected on islands in Antarctica and published by Gorman et al. (2014).

You can use them to reproduce my text. But feel also free to link other things if you want.\r\nLink to Allison Horst’s twitter: https://twitter.com/allison_horst\r\nLink to the paper: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081\r\nLink to the palmerpenguins package: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/\r\nLink to the penguin image: https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png?raw=true\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Add R code\r\n2.1 Load the palmerpenguins in your document\r\nWe will now include some analysis of the penguins data in the document.\r\nAs with “normal” R code, you need to load the palmerpenguins package in your document in the beginning.\r\nA convenient location to load packages is the setup code chunk.\r\nJust add library(palmerpenguins) as a line in this chunk.\r\nYou can always come back to the setup chunk and add all the packages that you need in your analysis. Then you have all the library() calls in one place.\r\n2.2 Add R code chunks\r\nNow let’s add some R code that produces different types of output in the document.\r\nThe different output types we will try using the penguin data set are:\r\nA figure\r\nA summary table\r\nFor each output type, go through the following steps:\r\nSelect a location in your document, where the output should be (probably the result section).\r\nInsert a new code chunk at the location\r\nUse the RStudio interface Code -> Insert Chunk or\r\nUse the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Alt/Option + I\r\nWrite the code that produces the output (you can copy it from my examples below)\r\nRun the code inside the document\r\nClick on the little green arrow button next to the code chunk\r\nCareful: if you get an error message, make sure that you run all chunks that your code depends on before. E.g. you probably have to run the setup chunk to load all the packages first.\r\nKnit the document and see how the output looks like\r\nBelow, you find example code for a figure and a table. I suggest, you copy my code to your R chunk. If you still have time, you can change the code or write new code chunks yourself.\r\nDon’t forget\r\nEvery time, you use a function from a new package, you have to load the package into the document environment. Just add another library() line to the setup chunk.\r\nKnit your document often to detect errors early on\r\n\r\nFigure\r\nI use ggplot2 to produce the figures, so don’t forget to load the package in the setup chunk.\r\nChose one of the two figure ideas from below:\r\nCreate a histogram of the body mass for the 3 penguin species\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6) +\r\n   scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")) +\r\n  theme_minimal()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a scatter plot of the relationship between bill length and bill depth\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot(\r\n  data = penguins,\r\n  aes(\r\n    x = bill_length_mm,\r\n    y = bill_depth_mm,\r\n    color = species,\r\n    shape = species\r\n  )\r\n) +\r\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\r\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\r\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")) +\r\n  theme_minimal()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary table\r\nI create a summary table of the mean variable values grouped by penguin species and sex.\r\nI use the dplyr package here, so don’t forget to load it in the setup chunk.\r\n\r\n\r\npenguins %>% \r\n  filter(!(is.na(sex))) %>% \r\n  group_by(species, sex) %>% \r\n  summarize(\r\n    bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.3 Add inline code\r\nAdd some sentences to the document that use R code to report numbers.\r\nYou can start with the example below. If you still have time in the end, you can add more sentences:\r\nReport the mean body mass of all penguins, e.g. like this:\r\nThe mean body mass of all penguins is 4202 g.\r\n\r\nExtra\r\nOnly do this if you are alredy finished with the Chunk option task below.\r\nCan you report the number of penguins and their body mass separately for the three penguin species?\r\nHint: Calculate the mean weight of the penguin species in a separate code chunk and save them in 3 variables. Then you can use these variables in the inline code.\r\n2.3 Chunk options\r\nNow modify some of the code chunk behaviour using chunk options.\r\nStart with the chunk that produces the figure:\r\nAdd a figure caption.\r\nIf you want, change the figure size using either fig.width and fig.height or out.width\r\nAlign the figure where you like to have it\r\nKnit the document and look at the output.\r\nNow think of some global chunk options that might make sense for your document. Add these options to the knitr options in the setup chunk.\r\nYou can for example think of things like:\r\nShould the R code be shown in the document?\r\nShould warnings and messages be printed into the document as well?\r\n\r\n3 Change YAML header\r\nWe will now add some additional YAML metadata and document options to the document.\r\nIn this task, you can test the options that you find most interesting. I will give you some suggestions to start with and if you still have time, you can explore other options as well.\r\nAlso here, knit your document often, to see the difference that the options make to the document and make sure that there is no bug.\r\n3.1 Add Metadata\r\nAdd today’s date to the document\r\nAdd a title and subtitle\r\n3.2 Document options\r\nToday, we only worked with html_document output. So add some options for this document type to the YAML header. Be careful to respect the rules of indentation.\r\nOptions that might be interesting to try on your document:\r\nAdd a table of contents. Explore the following options (start with those that seem most interesting to you):\r\ntoc_depth: an integer\r\ntoc: true or false\r\nnumber_sections: true or false\r\ntoc_float: true or false (HTML only option)\r\n\r\nTry different code highlighting themes using highlight option\r\nOptions are e.g. \"kate\", \"espresso\" or \"zenburn\"\r\n\r\nExtra\r\ndf_print: set it to \"kable\" and see how the style of the table that you printed looks like\r\nTry code_folding: \"hide\" (HTML only option) to hide code and make it available via a button\r\nTry a different theme, using the theme option (HTML only option)\r\nValues you can try are \"flatly\", \"journal\" or \"united\"\r\nHere you can find a list of other themes to try\r\n\r\nSet the option code_download to true. See what you can do with the button on the top right of the document.\r\nHave a look at ?rmarkdown::html_document. There you find a list of all the options you can set for an HTML document output. Try some that you find interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\npaper available here.↩︎\r\n",

How bill depth depends on bill length?\r\n2. Which penguin species has the highest body mass?\r\n\r\n# Methods\r\n\r\nAll analysis was done using R version 4.1.3 [@Rcore2022] and the R markdown package [@Allaire2021].\r\n\r\n## The data\r\n\r\nThe data was collected on islands in Antarctica and published by @gorman2014. You can find the original paper with the title \"Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a community of Antarctic penguins (genus *Pygoscelis*)\" [@gorman2014] in PLoS ONE[^1]\r\n\r\n[^1]: paper available [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081).\r\n\r\nThe data is published via the `palmerpenguins` R package [@horst2020] which you can find [on this website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).\r\n\r\n**The data contains (among others) the following measurements:**\r\n\r\n- bill length\r\n- bill depth\r\n- body mass\r\n- sex\r\n  - male\r\n  - female\r\n\r\n\r\n## The analysis\r\n\r\nWe did some plots, calculated some summary statistics and a linear model of the \r\nform $y = ax + b + \\epsilon$\r\n\r\n\r\n# Results\r\n\r\n```{r mean-penguin-species, include=FALSE}\r\n# calculate the mean body mass of the penguin species\r\nadelie_mean <- penguins %>% filter(species == \"Adelie\") %>% \r\n                  pull(body_mass_g)

\r\n*Gentoo* penguins have an average weight of `r round(gentoo_mean,0)` g,\r\n*Adelie* penguins of `r round(adelie_mean, 0)` g and \r\n*Chinstrap* penguins of `r round(chinstrap_mean, 0)` g.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figure below shows that *Gentoo* penguins have the highest body mass.\r\n\r\n```{r histogram-body, fig.cap=\"Histogram of weight of the three penguin species.\",\r\nfig.width=4,

Add Citation\r\n\r\n2 Multiple output formats\r\n2.1 Add other output formats to your document\r\n2.2 Customize your favourite output format\r\n\r\n3 Make nice tables\r\n\r\n1 Add citations\r\n1.1 Explore the visual editor\r\nOpen your R Markdown document from the last task.\r\nSwitch to the visual editor by clicking on the RStudio compass button on the top right of the document.\r\nFirst, scroll through your document and see how it looks different from the original document view.\r\nTake 5 minutes and explore the visual editor. If you want, you can try to e.g.,\r\nInsert a link ( button)\r\nTurn some text bold,\r\n…\r\nAfter you inserted an element, switch back to the normal R Studio editor view (click on the compass button again) and see how your original document changed.\r\n1.2. Add Citation\r\nAdd citation of Gorman et al. (2014) via visual editor\r\nFirst, cite the original paper that published and analysed the penguin data set. The paper is by Gorman et al. (2014).\r\nSwitch to the visual editor and\r\nSelect a location in the text to add the citation\r\nClick the insert citation button (@ symbol) on top\r\nSelect From DOI and search the DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0090081. This should list the Gorman paper.\r\nBefore inserting the citation, have a look at the options that the Insert Citation window offers. On the bottom, There is a check box to chose between in-text (without brackets) or normal (in brackets) citation. You can leave the rest at the default settings.\r\nNow hit Insert and see what changed in the document:\r\nSee how RStudio automatically created a references.bib file in your project (the same location where your *.Rmd file is located)\r\nOpen references.bib in the editor to see how it looks like\r\nLook at the YAML header to find the reference file added there automatically\r\nKnit the document and check that the citation was added correctly in the text and that the reference is listed at the end of the document\r\nAdd citation of the palmerpenguins package\r\nNow use a different method to add a second citation of the palmerpenguins package.\r\nOpen the references.bib file in RStudio (or any other text editor) and add the following BibTeX entry in a new line:\r\n@Manual{horst2020,\r\n    title = {palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data},\r\n    author = {Allison Marie Horst and Alison Presmanes Hill and Kristen B Gorman},\r\n    year = {2020},\r\n    note = {R package version 0.1.0},\r\n    doi = {10.5281/zenodo.3960218},\r\n    url = {https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/},\r\n  }\r\nSave the file and close it.\r\nNow go to you R Markdown document, switch to the visual editor and select a location where you want to add the new citation.\r\nStart typing @horst2020 in the text. You should see that RStudio starts suggesting references that match this name. From the list, select the citation of the palmerpenguins package.\r\nKnit the document.\r\nWere citation and reference added correctly to the text?\r\nExtras\r\nPlay with adding both in-text and normal citations. You can search citations via DOI or one of the other methods. If you have Zotero, you can also try to add a reference from there.\r\n\r\n2 Multiple output formats\r\n2.1 Add other output formats to your document\r\nGo to the YAML section of your R Markdown document and add a new pdf_document and word_document (or odt_document if you have Open Office instead of MS Word) into the list of outputs. For now, just specify, that these outputs should take the default values.\r\nMake sure that the indentation is correct.\r\nKnow knit your document to these different formats (using the little arrow next to the Knit button) and see how the output looks like.\r\n2.2 Customize your favourite output format\r\nChose one of the output formats that you’d like to customize a bit more. Either chose the one you like best or the one your are most likely to use for your work. If you finish early, you can also try a second output format\r\npdf_document\r\nAdd some YAML options to this output format e.g. to\r\nNumber the figures\r\nAdd a table of contents\r\nChange code highlighting\r\nGive the URLs some color\r\nChange the font size\r\n…\r\nSee the R Markdown cheat sheet for YAML options that apply for this document type\r\nword_document/odt_document\r\nAdd some YAML options to this output format to\r\nNumber the figures\r\nAdd a table of contents\r\nChange code highlighting\r\n…\r\nSee the R Markdown cheat sheet for YAML options that apply for this document type\r\nhtml_document\r\nYou can\r\nInsert a tabbed section\r\nTurn the plot into an interactive one\r\nChange some of the YAML options that you have not explored so far\r\nSee the R Markdown cheat sheet for YAML options that apply for this document type\r\n\r\n3 Make nice tables\r\nBefore you start the task, chose one of two packages to start with.\r\nIf you want to put a focus on word_document output, I recommend to try the flextable package because it works better for word output\r\nIf you want to put a focus on pdf_document or html_document, I highly recommend to use knitr::kable in combinations with kableExtra because it’s easy to use and very flexible.\r\nNow try to make the table that is already included in your document more beautiful.\r\nA tip to start is to first save the table in a new variable. Then you can pass this variable into the table functions:\r\n\r\n\r\npenguins_sum <- penguins %>%\r\n  filter(!(is.na(sex))) %>%\r\n  group_by(species, sex) %>%\r\n  summarize(\r\n    bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),\r\n    body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n  )\r\npenguins_sum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOption 1 kable and kableExtra\r\nDon’t forget to load the packages knitr and kableExtra in the setup chunk.\r\nStart with the kable function. You can for example:\r\nAdd a caption\r\nRestrict the number of digits printed\r\nChange the column headers\r\nChange the alignment of text in the cells\r\nUse booktabs option (only works in PDF output, is ignored for HTML output)\r\nKnit the document in your target output format and see how the table looks like.\r\nNow start adding some extra styling using the kableExtra package. For example, you can\r\nApply some kable_styling, e.g\r\nFont size\r\nPosition of the table or full width table\r\nSpecify latex_options and/or bootstrap_options\r\n\r\nChange the table theme using one of the kable_* themes (only HTML)\r\nHave a look at C:/Users/Selina_User/Documents/R/R-4.1.0/library/kableExtra/help/kable_styling for more options.\r\nOption 2 flextable\r\nDon’t forget to load the flextable package in the setup chunk.\r\nStart by setting the default flex table options in the setup chunk.\r\nHave a look at the example on the slide and check out ?flextable::set_flextable_defaults\r\nNow print the table in your document as a flextable by passing it into the flextable() function.\r\nCustomize the look further, e.g. by\r\nChanging the header labels\r\nAdding a table caption\r\nApplying the formatting for the double columns\r\nIf you still have time, move from Word to HTML or PDF output and try the other packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can just scroll through the table of contents of the book to see what you can do with rmarkdown and get inspiration.\r\nR markdown cookbook: Covers the basics and different document types. Is more structured by docuemnt elements than by document types. Also here, you can scroll through the table of contents to see what is possible and how to do it.\r\nA list of R Markdown books: This list contains the two above-mentioned books but also lists some other books about R Markdown that are freely available\r\nR markdown cheat sheet: Handy as a reference while working\r\nComprehensive Markdown cheat sheet: Not exactly pandoc flavoured markdown but most of the things work the same.
