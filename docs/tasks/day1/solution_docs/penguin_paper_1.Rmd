# Introduction

There are three main penguin species in Antarctica
(*Chinstrap*, *Gentoo*, *Adelie*). You can see them in the following figure:

In this paper we want to answer the following questions

1. How bill depth depends on bill length?
2. Which penguin species has the highest body mass?

# Methods

## The data

The data was collected on islands in Antarctica and published by 
Gorman et al. (2014). You can find the original paper with the title
"Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a 
community of Antarctic penguins (genus *Pygoscelis*)" in 
PLoS ONE^[paper available [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081).]

The data is published via the `palmerpenguins` R package which you
can find [on this website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

**The data contains (among others) the following measurements:**

- bill length
- bill depth
- body mass
- sex
  - male
  - female


## The analysis

We did some plots, calculated some summary statistics and a linear model of the 
form $y = ax + b + \epsilon$


# Results

Will be added later
