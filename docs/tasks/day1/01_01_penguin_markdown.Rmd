### 1.1 Preparing the data

To practice, we will write a short paper about a data set on 3 different penguin species (*Chinstrap*, *Gentoo*, and *Adelie*) on islands in Antarctica. 
As we progress in the workshop, we will incorporate more options, functionality and formatting into the document.

The data is available from the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package. To get it, you have to open RStudio and:

- Install the package with `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`

Take a moment to get familiar with the data set and its variables:
    
- Load the package into your R session with `library(palmerpenguins)` (just do this in the console)
- Type `penguins` in the console and you should see the penguins tibble
- It contains data on bill and flipper size, weight and sex of the 3 penguin species

We will need the data later, so remember that you can access via the variable `penguins`.

### 1.2 Create first `rmarkdown` document

For all tasks of today, you might find it helpful, to open the [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) for reference.

Start by creating a new `.Rmd` file:

- Go to `File` -> `New File` -> `R Markdown...` and 
- Chose `HTML` as default output format from the `Document` section (This should be already selected as default)
- If you want, you can already enter a title and author

Create and save the file in a convenient location on your machine.

Before you start working with the document:

- Knit the document to see what happens
  - Try the Knit button on top of your document or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K`
  - Chose different output formats to knit to by clicking on the little black arrow next to the Knit button
  
### 1.2 Add some text

Now start writing your very own paper about the 3 penguins. 

First, remove all template text from the document **except** the YAML header and the first code chunk (we will learn later what that does).

Before you start writing, have a quick look at the `Example text` that I show below. It is the one we discussed together just now and includes many different markdown formatting elements and some text about the penguin data set.

Now write a text yourself.

You can either reproduce my text and use copy paste to type less, or you can write your own text about penguins (or anything else you want to write about).

The important thing in this task is to include many different markdown formatting elements.

You can find the links that I used in the text in the `Links` section or by right clicking on the text

During the writing process, **don't forget to knit your document often**. It's easier to fix mistakes and error messages if you detect them early.

# Example text

## The penguins of Antarctica

#### Selina Baldauf

#### 25/03/2022

### Introduction

There are three main penguin species in Antarctica (*Chinstrap*, *Gentoo*, *Adelie*). You can see them in the following figure:

![Artwork by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/blob/master/man/figures/lter_penguins.png?raw=true)

In this paper we want to answer the following questions

1. How does bill depth depend on bill length?
2. Which penguin species has the highest body mass?

### Methods

#### The data

The data was collected on islands in Antarctica and published by Gorman et al. (2014). You can find the original paper with the title "Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a community of Antarctic penguins (genus *Pygoscelis*)" in PLoS ONE^[paper available [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081).]

The data is published via the `palmerpenguins` R package which you can find [on this website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

**The data contains (among others) the following measurements:**

- bill length
- bill depth
- body mass
- sex
  - male
  - female

#### The analysis

We did some plots, calculated some summary statistics and a linear model of the 
form $y = ax + b + \epsilon$

### Results

Will be added later
