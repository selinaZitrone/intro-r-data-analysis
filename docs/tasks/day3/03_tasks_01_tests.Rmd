### Compare the flipper length of penguins using statistical tests

Question: Does the mean flipper length differ between the 3 penguin species?

Do separate comparisons for

- Gentoo vs. Adelie
- Gentoo vs. Chinstrap
- Adelie vs. Chinstrap

Before you start, create a subset of each species as a vector.

For this, you can use the `$` operator:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")$flipper_length_mm
```

Follow the decision tree for statistical tests:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("slides/img/day3/tests_overview.png"))
```

#### Extra

- Create a boxplot with notches to visually compare differences in flipper length between species
