### 1.1 Getting started with ggplot and the tidyverse

A helpful resource for to consult for this task can be the [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).

Before you start, make sure to install the `tidyverse` packages by calling

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(tidyverse)
```

This will install ggplot2 along with other tidyverse packages.

Remember to put `library(tidyverse)` (or `library(ggplot2)`) on top of your script to access the ggplot functions.

### 1.2 Getting the data

To practice plotting, we will use a data set on 3 species of penguins on islands in Antarctica.

```{r fig.cap="Artwork by Artwork by [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("tasks/day2/img/lter_penguins.png"))
```

The data is available in the from the [palmerpenguins package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

- Install the package with `install.packages("palmerpenguins")`
- Load the package at the beginning of your script
- Look at the data set `penguins` and its variables
  - just type `penguins` in the console

### 1.3 Exploratory plotting

### 1.4 Can you reproduce the plot from the slides?
