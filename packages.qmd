title: "List of R packages"
---

In the table below, you can find a list of R packages with a short description and 
some links for further reading. The package selection is based on my personal experience and
packages that I regularly use and like. The list is in no way complete. If you know a useful package 
that I missed, let me know and I can add it to the list.


```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: read-pkg
pkg <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/packages.xlsx")
knitr::kable(pkg)
```
