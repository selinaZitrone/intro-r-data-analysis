### 1.1 Getting the data

You can read the data set directly from Github using:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
treeheights <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selinaZitrone/intro-r-data-analysis/master/data/treeheight.csv")
```

The data contains tree heights for different forest regions. Check out which regions are included in the data set by calling

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
unique(treeheights$region)
```

### 1.2 Comparing the regions using statistical tests

Compare the means of the forests separately

- forest1 - forest2
- forest1 - forest3
- forest2 - forest3

Before you start, create a subset of each forest site as a vector.

Follow the decision tree for statistical tests:

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("slides/img/day3/tests_overview.png"))
```

Use the Shapiro-Wilk test to test for normality

#### Extra

- Create a boxplot with notches to visually compare differences between forests

Can you see how the different methods might lead to different results?

- Create a QQ-Plot for the data. Here you can't use the subsetted vectors as data, as ggplot expects a tibble or data frame as first argument. Can you create the QQ-Plots from the `treeheights` tibble? 
- Use the KS-Test to test for normality
