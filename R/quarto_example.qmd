# Introduction

There are three main penguin species in Antarctica (*Chinstrap*, *Gentoo*, *Adelie*). You can see them in @fig-illustration:

```{r}
#| label: fig-illustration
#| fig-cap: Illustration of the three penguin species by Allison Horst
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "60%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/lter_penguins.png")
```

In this paper we want to answer the following questions

1.  How bill depth depends on bill length?
2.  Which penguin species has the highest body mass?

# Methods

All analysis was done using R version 4.1.3 [@Rcore2022] and Quarto [@quarto-2]

## The data

The data was collected on islands in Antarctica and published by @gorman2014. You can find the original paper with the title "Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a community of Antarctic penguins (genus *Pygoscelis*)" [@gorman2014] in PLoS ONE[^1]

[^1]: paper available [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081).

The data is published via the `palmerpenguins` R package [@horst2020] which you can find [on this website](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

**The data contains (among others) the following measurements:**

-   bill length
-   bill depth
-   body mass
-   sex
    -   male
    -   female

## The analysis

We did some plots, calculated some summary statistics and a linear model of the form $y = ax + b + \epsilon$

# Results

```{r}
#| label: mean-penguin-species
#| include: false

# calculate the mean body mass of the penguin species
adelie_mean <- penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  pull(body_mass) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
chinstrap_mean <- penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>%
  pull(body_mass) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
gentoo_mean <- penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Gentoo") %>%
  pull(body_mass) %>%
  mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean weight of all penguin species is `r mean(penguins$body_mass, na.rm = TRUE)` g. *Gentoo* penguins have an average weight of `r round(gentoo_mean,0)` g, *Adelie* penguins of `r round(adelie_mean, 0)` g and *Chinstrap* penguins of `r round(chinstrap_mean, 0)` g.

@fig-hist below shows that *Gentoo* penguins have the highest body mass.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: Histogram of weight of the three penguin species.
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 3

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Body mass (g)",
    y = "Count",
    color = "Species"
  )
```

There is a positive relationship between bill length and bill depth for all 3 species, as @fig-scatter shows.

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter
#| fig-cap: Scatter plot with regression lines showing the relationship between bill length and bill depth for the 3 penguin species

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  aes(
    x = bill_len,
    y = bill_dep,
    color = species,
    shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Bill length (mm)",
    y = "Bill depth (mm)",
    color = "Species",
    shape = "Species"
  )
```

In general, it looks like the body characteristics differ between the sexes but also between the penguin species, as @tbl-summary below illustrates:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: A summary of the penguin data
penguins %>%
  filter(!(is.na(sex))) %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarize(
    bill_length = mean(bill_len, na.rm = TRUE),
    bill_depth = mean(bill_dep, na.rm = TRUE),
    flipper_length = mean(flipper_len, na.rm = TRUE),
    body_mass = mean(body_mass, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
