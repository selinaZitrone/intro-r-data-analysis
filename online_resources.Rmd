## General

- [List of RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): You can find a list of all the cheat sheets that RStudio provides there. Below, I listed the individual cheat sheets that are interesting for our course.

- [RStudio cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rstudio-ide.pdf): Explains the most important buttons, options, keyboard shortcuts, etc that you have in RStudio.

- [The modern dive book](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#code) explains how to get started with R and data analysis with the tidyverse.

- The [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham is a very good book to start with.

- The [Big book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/) is a book that list all books about R that are freely available only. The book is sorted by topics and can be used to find resources to learn a specific topic.

## Tidyverse

- The [tidyverse website](https://tidyverse.org/) has links to all tidyverse packages which all have very good examples and use cases. These websites are an excelent point to get started with a package.

### readr

### ggplot

- [ggplot cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) offers an overview of all possibilities of ggplot

- [error bars with ggplot](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/ggplot-error-bars/) A good summary of how to plot different types of means and errorbars (barplots, mean and errorbar, ...).

- In the [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) you can browse through hundreds of different types of plots and find code to reproduce them.

- A great [presentation by Cédric Scherer](https://github.com/z3tt/OutlierConf2021) with examples of how to beautify your ggplots.

### dplyr

## Twitter accounts to follow

I personally learn a lot of tricks and find a lot of inspiration and resources by following some R people and accounts on twitter. Often people post helpful tutorials or blogpost that you would not find otherwise. If you are a twitter user, you can try that as well.
Some suggestions are:

- [Cédric Scherer](https://twitter.com/CedScherer) mainly data visualization and ggplot content
- [Allison Horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)
- [RStudio](https://twitter.com/rstudio) official RStudio account
- [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) data visualisation, tidyverse
- [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan)
- [rOpenSci](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci) develop R tools for open science
- [One R Tip a Day](https://twitter.com/RLangTip) one helpful R tip every day
