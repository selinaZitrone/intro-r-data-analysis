## The Data

The dataset used in this analysis is from Cortez et al. (2009), which models wine preferences based on physicochemical properties.
You can read the data directly from the [ecodata R package](https://github.com/TheoreticalEcology/ecodata) on Github:

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
# Define the raw URL for the .rda file
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheoreticalEcology/ecodata/master/data/wine.rda"

# Load the .rda file directly from the URL
load(url(url))

# Convert the data to a tibble
wine <- tibble(wine)

# Checkout the data
wine
```

Before analyzing, clean the variable names and ensure the quality variable is treated as a factor.

To prepare the data:

- Transform the quality column to a factor before plotting: use `dplyr::mutate` and `as.factor()` to tranform the column
- Try the `janitor::clean_names()` function

## Questions

#### 1. How do physicochemical properties relate to wine quality?
   - Try different visualizations of all the variables

#### 2. What is the correlation between the physicochemical properties?
   - For this you first need to calculate the correlation matrix and then visualize it
   - Tip: Use `corrplot()` to visualize the correlation matrix

#### 3. How can Principal Component Analysis (PCA) be used to understand the data?
   - Tip: Use `prcomp()` for PCA and visualize with `fviz_pca_var()`.

## Useful Functions

- `janitor::clean_names()`: To clean variable names.
- `cor()`: To calculate correlation matrices.
- `drop_na()`: To drop missing values before doing the correlation/PCA
- `corrplot()` from the `corrplot` package: To visualize correlation matrices.

- `ggcorrplot` from the `ggcorrplot` pacakge: Alternative visualization for correlation matrices
  - Find the [package documentation](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggcorrplot/index.html) here
- `prcomp()`: To perform PCA.
- `fviz_pca_var()`, `fviz_pca_ind()`, `fviz_pca_biplot()` from the `factoextra` package: For PCA visualization.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
downloadthis::download_file(
  path = here::here("R/byod/solutions_for_my_datasets/wine.R"),
  output_name = "solution_wine",
  button_label = "Download solution script",
  button_type = "default",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = FALSE
)
```
