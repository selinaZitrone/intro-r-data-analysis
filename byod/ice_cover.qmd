title: "Climate Change Effects on Ice Cover and Temperature in North American Lakes"

## Data Description

There are two time series data sets from North American lakes since the 19th century:

- ice cover data: ice start, end and duration
- temperature data: daily air temperature since 1870

This is how the data looks like:

Ice data:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# install.packages("lterdatasampler")
library(lterdatasampler)
head(ntl_icecover)
```

Temperature data:

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(ntl_airtemp)
```

You can analyse the data separately or together to explore the effects of climate change on ice cover and temperature in North American lakes.

### How to get the data

The data are part of the [lterdatasampler package](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/index.html). You can obtain them by installing the package, loading it in your script, and then using the datasets `ntl_icecover` and `ntl_airtemp`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("lterdatasampler")
library(lterdatasampler)
ntl_icecover
ntl_airtemp
```

If you want to know more about the variables in the datasets, you can use the `help` function:

```{r}
#| eval: false
?ntl_icecover
?ntl_airtemp
```

## Questions to Explore

Here are some questions you can try to answer using the datasets:

#### 1. How did the ice cover duration change over the years? Is there a difference between the lakes?

#### 2. How has the average air temperature changed over the years? Can you identify any trends or patterns?

- Tip: Calculate average yearly temperature first.

#### 3. Are there any significant temperature anomalies in the dataset? If so, when did they occur?

  - Tip: You can define an anomaly relative to a reference period (1870-1900). The standardized anomalies are calculated like this: `anomaly_std = (temperature - mean(reference period)) / sd(reference period)`
  - First, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the reference period and add them as a new column to the data (use `bind_cols` to combine the two tables). Then you can easily calculate the anomalies.
  - See below for an example plot
  
#### 4. How does the temperature curve over one year change with time?
  - Tip: Calculate mean monthly temperature and plot it over each year.
  
#### 5. Is there a correlations between ice cover duration and temperature?
  - Tip: This is a bit tricky because you need to combine the two datasets. 
  It makes sense to correlate temperature and ice duration in one winter season (fall season of the year + spring season of the next year) with the mean temperature in that winter.
  Since a winter spans two years, you need to consider how to calculate average temperature in one winter.
  First, filter only the winter months (November to April) and change the year of the spring months to the previous year. Then calculate the mean temperature for each winter season.
  
## Useful functions

- functions from the [`Lubridate` package](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/): to work with dates (also part of the tidyverse):
  - `year()`: extract the year from a date
  - `month()`: extract the month from a date

- `dplyr` to summarize data and to combine tables:
  - `left_join()`: to combine two tables by a common column
  - `bind_cols()`: to combine two tables by columns (just glue them together)

## Example analysis

Here is an example of a plot you can try to create (from question 3):
