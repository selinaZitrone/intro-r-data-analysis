  - presentations
  - tasks
  - solutions
  - additional resources

--

- [Joint document](https://hackmd.io/@selinaZitrone/r12pL71C_/edit) for all participants
  - collection of everything that comes up during the workshop
  - questions we should discuss together
  - additional resources and helpful links that you found
  - things we could look at if we have enough time

---

# Last workshop day: Bring your own data

- small Hackaton on last workshop day

- work on your own research data in small groups (or alone if you prefer)
    - I will also provide some real life data sets from different topics

--
**Idea**

- define a question/goal beforehand and then work on it
- use any of the methods from the course, try new thing, ...
- present your results at the end of the day

---

# Bring your own data - preparation

- keep the last workshop day in mind during the next days

  - take note if you learn something that might be applicable to your data
  
  - think of questions that you would like to answer for your data set
  
--

- during the group work

  - when you are finished with the group tasks: talk about your own data and questions -> you might already find common interests and questions
  
---

# Bring your own data - preparation

If you think you have a suitable data set:

- send it to me via email with a short description
  - I will check if the data is suitable
  - I will let you know what you have to do to prepare the data set for the Hackaton

- Tomorrow we will learn about good practices for data preparation

--

If you want to offer your data set for the Hackaton:

- Add it to our [joint document](https://hackmd.io/@selinaZitrone/r12pL71C_/edit)
- Others can go through the list and add their names to the data set they are interested in

---
# Before we get started I

This is the first time that I am doing this workshop.

So any feedback is very welcome.

I am curious to know

- what you liked/disliked
- what you missed
- which tasks were too easy/too difficult or just right
- ...

If you have feedback or suggestions please let me know.

# Why learn `r fa("r-project")`?

- free and open source

- lingua franca in computational statistics (can I find a graph?)

- regular updates, large community

- packages for extensions

- easy documentation

- reproducible workflows

- ...

BUT: You have to learn some programming (I see this as an advantage though)

# Comments

- Comments are like notes that you can add to your code to make it more readable
- Everything that follows a `#` is a comment
- Comments are not evaluated
- Comments can be used for
  - Explanation of your code (only if necessary)
  - Include a link to a website where you found the solution
  - Mark different sections of your code (`r fa("lightbulb")` try `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R`)

# Variables

- store values under meaningful names to reuse them

--

- a variable has a .col1[<b>name</b>] and .col2[<b>value</b>] and is created using the .col3[<b>assignment operator</b>]

.center[.large[.strong[.col1[radius] &nbsp; .col3[<-] &nbsp; .col2[5]]]]

--
- variable are available in the global environment (remember the Environment pane of RStudio?)
--
- R is case sensitive: **r**adius != **R**adius
--
- choose meaningful variable names
  - make your code easier to read
  - variable names should start with a letter

---

# Variables


```{r eval=FALSE}
# create a variable
radius <- 5
# use it in a calculation and save the result
circumference <- 2 * pi * radius
# change value of variable radius
radius <- radius + 1
```` 
--
```{r eval=FALSE}
# print a variable's value -----------------------
radius # just use the name to print the value
# or print it in a sentence
print(paste0("With a radius of ", radius, " the circumference is ",
             circumference)) 
# does this print the correct circumference for radius?
```
--
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Remove variables from global environment -------
rm(radius) # remove radius
rm(list = ls()) # remove all elements
```

---

# Atomic data types

There are 6 so-called atomic data types in R. The 4 most important are:
--
<br><br>
**Numeric:** There are two numeric data types: 

  **Double:** can be specified in decimal (`1.243` or `-0.2134`), scientific notation (`2.32e4`) or hexadecimal (`0xd3f1`)

  **Integer:** numbers that are not represented by fraction. Must be followed by an `L` (`1L`, `2038459L`, `-5L`)
<br><br>
--

**Logical:** only two possible values `TRUE` and `FALSE` (abbreviation: `T` or `F` - but better use non-abbreviated form)
--

<br><br>
**Character:** also called string. Sequence of characters surrounded by quotes (`"hello"` , `"sample_1"`)

---
# Check the type of a variable

- check the type of a variable with `typeof()`
- check if a variable is of a specific data type with `is.*()`

```{r}
var <- 123L
typeof(var)
is.integer(var)
is.double(var)
is.numeric(var)
is.integer(123)
is.logical(TRUE)
is.logical("TRUE")
is.character("TRUE")
is.character(FALSE)
```

---
# Explicit type conversion

You can convert a value from one data type to the other using `as*()`

```{r}
as.character(1L)
as.integer(TRUE)
as.double(FALSE)
as.integer("hello")
as.integer("2")
```

---
# Implicit type conversion

Type conversion can happen implicitly

```{r error=TRUE}
typeof(1L + 2.5) # integer -> double
typeof(1L + TRUE) # logical -> integer (TRUE = 1, FALSE = 0)
typeof(1.34 + FALSE) # logical -> double
typeof("hello" + FALSE) # Error: no implicit conversion from string to other data types
```

# Vectors

---

# Vectors

Vectors are data structures that are built onto atomic data types.<br>
Imagine a vector as a **collection of values** that are all **of the same data type**.

.center[

![](img/day1/vector_data_type.png)
]

.footnote-right[Image from [Advanced R book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#atomic-vectors)]

---

# Creating vectors: `c()`

We can use the function `c()` to *combine* values into a vector

```{r}
lgl_var <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
dbl_var <- c(2.5, 3.4, 4.3)
int_var <- c(1L, 45L, 234L)
chr_var <- c("These are", "just", "some strings")
```
--
You can also combine multiple vectors into one:

```{r}
# Combine multiple vectors
v1 <- c(1,2,3)
v2 <- c(800, 83, 37)
v3 <- c(v1, v2)
# Be aware of implicit type conversion when combining
# vectors of different types
c(int_var, lgl_var)
```

---

# Creating vectors: `:` and `seq()`

The `:` operator creates a sequence between to numbers with an increment of (-)1
```{r}
1:10
```
--

The `seq()` function creates a sequence of values

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1) # specify increment of sequence with by
seq(from = 1, to = 10, length.out = 10) # specify desired length with length.out
```

---

# Creating vectors: `rep()`

Repeat values multiple times with `rep()`

```{r}
rep("hello", times = 5)
```
--

You can also repeat entire vectors

```{r}
rep(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), times = 2) # repeat the whole vector twice
```

```{r}
rep(c(1, 2 ,3), each = 2) # repeat each element of the vector twice
```

---

# Working with vectors

Let's create some vectors to work with.


```{r}
# list of 10 biggest cities in Europe
cities <- c("Istanbul", "Moscow", "London", "Saint Petersburg", "Berlin", "Madrid", "Kyiv", "Rome", "Bucharest", "Paris")

population <- c(15.1e6, 12.5e6, 9e6, 5.4e6, 3.8e6, 3.2e6, 3e6, 2.8e6, 2.2e6, 2.1e6)

area_km2 <- c(2576, 2561, 1572, 1439,891,604, 839, 1285, 228, 105 )
```

--
We can check the length of a vector using the `length()` function:

```{r}
length(cities)
```

.footnote-right[Data from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_cities_by_population_within_city_limits)]

---

# Working with vectors

Divide the population and area vector to calculate the population density in each city:

```{r}
population / area_km2
```

The operation is performed separately for each element of the two vectors and the result is a vector.<br>
--

The same happens, if a vector is divided by vector of length 1 (i.e. a single number).
The result is always a vector.

```{r}
mean_population <- mean(population) # calculate the mean of vector population
population / mean_population
```

---

# Working with vectors

We can also work with relational and logical operators

```{r}
population > mean_population
```

The result is a vector containing `TRUE` and `FALSE`, depending on whether the city's population is larger than the mean population or not.

--
Logical and relational operators can also be combined

```{r}
# population larger than mean population OR population larger than 3 million
population > mean_population | population > 3e6
```

---

# Working with vectors

The `%in%` operator checks whether *multiple* elements occur in a vector.

So instead of writing this:

```{r}
cities == "Istanbul" | cities == "Berlin" | cities == "Madrid"
```
we can also write this: 

```{r}
to_check <- c("Istanbul", "Berlin", "Madrid")
cities %in% to_check
```

---
# Indexing vectors

You can use square brackets `[]` to access specific elements from an object.
The basic structure is:<br><br>
.center.strong[[.col1[vector] [ .col2[vector of indexes to select] ]]]
--
```{r}
cities[5]
```
--
```{r}
cities[1:3] # the three most populated cities
```
--
```{r}
cities[length(cities)] # the last entry of the cities vector
```

---

# Indexing vectors

Change the values of a vector at specified indexes using the assignment operator `<-`

Imagine for example, that the population of 
- Istanbul (index 1) increased to 20 Million
- Rome (index 8) changed but is unknown
- Paris (index 10) decreased by 200,000.

--

```{r}
# first copy the original vector to leave it untouched
population_new <- population
# Update Istanbul (1) and Rome(8)
population_new[c(1, 8)] <- c(20e6, NA) # NA means missing value
# Update Paris (10)
population_new[10] <- population_new[10] - 200000 
```

```{r}
population_new
```

---

# Indexing vectors

You can also index a vector using logical tests. The basic structure is:<br>

.center[.strong[.col1[vector][.col2[ logical vector of same length ]]]]

```{r}
mega_city <- population > mean_population
mega_city
```

Now extract only the cities that return `TRUE` for the comparison of their population
