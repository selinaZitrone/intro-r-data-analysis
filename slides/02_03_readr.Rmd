# Readr

`readr` is a tidyverse package so to use it you can do one of the following things:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # or library(readr) 
```

--

The most important functions are:

- `read_csv()`/`write_csv()` to read/write **comma delimited** files

- `read_csv2()`/`write_csv2()` to read/write **semicolon delimited** files

- `read_tsv()`/`write_tsv()` to read/write **tab delimited** files

- `read_delim()`/`write_delim()` to read/write files with **any delimiter**

---
# Read files with `read_*()`

All `read_*()` functions take a path to the data file as a first argument:

.center[<code><b>read_*(path = .col2["path/to/your/file"], ...)</b></code>]

--

Import files with a `readr` function fitting the delimiter of your file:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("./data/your_data.csv") # comma delimiter

dat <- read_csv2("./data/your_data.txt") # semicolon delimiter

dat <- read_tsv("./data/your_data.txt") # tab delimiter
```

--

Use `read_delim` for a generic type of delimiter:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dat <- read_delim("./data/your_data.txt", delim = "\t") # tab delimiter

dat <- read_delim(here("/data/your_data.txt", delim = "..xyz..") # ..xyz.. delimiter
```

--

All `read_*()` functions return a `tibble`

---
# Read files with `read_*()`

Have a look at `?read_delim` for more options.

You can e.g.

- specify number of lines to skip reading with `skip`

--

- specify whether the data has a header column or not with `col_names = TRUE/FALSE`

--

- change the data types of columns while reading them with `col_types`

- ...

---
# Write files with `write_*()`

Every `read_*()` function has a corresponding `write_*()` function to export data from R.

--

Write data from R e.g.

- If tasks take a lot of time and you want to do them only once
  - Run the code, save the intermediate result, work with intermediate result

- To share transformed data

- ...

---
# Write files with `write_*()`

All `write_*()` functions take the data to write as the first and the path to write to as the second argument:

.center[<code><b>write_*(x = .col1[dat], path = .col2["path/to/save/file"], ...)</b></code>]

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_csv(dat, file = "./data-clean/your_data.csv") # comma delimiter

write_csv2(dat, file = "./data-clean/your_data.txt") # semicolon delimiter

read_tsv(dat, "./data-clean/your_data.txt") # tab delimiter
```

--

Use `write_delim` for a generic type of delimiter:

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_delim(dat, file = "./data/your_data.txt", delim = "\t") # tab delimiter

write_delim(dat, here("/data/your_data.txt", delim = "..xyz..") # ..xyz.. delimiter
```

# Absolute vs. relative paths

#### Absolute paths

`C:/Users/Selina/some_folder/another_folder/data/file_to_read.csv`

#### Relative paths

`./data/file_to_read.csv`

--

- relative paths are interpreted relative to the **working directory**
  - the `./` in the path stands for the working directory

- check out where your working directory is with `getwd()`

- in RStudio projects, the working directory is always the project root

---
# Absolute vs. relative paths

Working with R and RStudio, the best way is to:

- **Organize your work in an RStudio project**
  - The project root is automatically the working directory
  - All your files are in one place

- **Use paths relative to the project root**

--

#### Why?

--

- no need to change the working directory

--


- portable paths: will also work on other machines that copied the project

--

- makes the code more readable

--

- less error prone

# Data format

Follow these guidelines to make data import to R easier and less frustrating

- Readable file format: `.csv`, `.txt` & Co instead of `.xlsx`

--

Save an Excel spreadsheet as csv or txt either by

1. `File -> Save As` and select comma separated from the drop down menu
2. `File -> Export`

# Data format

Follow these guidelines to make data import to R easier and less frustrating

- Readable file format: `.csv`, `.txt` & Co instead of `.xlsx`

- No white space in column headers
  - use a character as separator, e.g. `species_name` instead of `species name`

  - if this is unpractical, have a look at the function `janitor::clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

--

- Avoid special characters
  - no ä, ö, ü, ß, é, ê, ...

--

- Avoid empty cells
  - if you have missing values, put `NA` in the cell

---
# Paths

- Avoid white space in paths

  - `data-raw/my_data.csv` instead of `data raw/my_data.csv`

--

- Avoid special characters in paths

  - no ä, ö, ü, ß, é, ê, ...
